# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — README

Welcome! This README provides an entry point to the project management process documentation for OctoAcme. Here you'll find authoritative, versioned guides on how OctoAcme plans, executes, tracks, and continuously improves its projects.

## Overview of Project Management Processes

OctoAcme's project management is built on a five-phase lifecycle: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective. Each phase leverages key artifacts—Project One-pagers, risk registers, prioritized backlogs, and clear acceptance criteria—ensuring projects are customer-focused and iterative, from idea to delivered value. Work increments are small and measurable, with a strong emphasis on clarity and transparency.

Team roles and responsibilities are clearly defined: Project Managers own coordination, risk, and timelines; Product Managers champion customer outcomes and prioritization; Developers are responsible for implementation quality; QA ensures standards and acceptance criteria are met; Scrum Masters facilitate agile practices and remove blockers; User Experience Leads ensure user-centric design; Data Analysts provide metrics and insights; and Stakeholder Champions bridge external stakeholders with the delivery team. Regular communication rhythms—daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and structured status updates—support fast feedback and shared accountability. Stakeholder communication, risk escalation paths, and incident response playbooks are all standardized using templates in the docs/ folder.

Risk management is ongoing: risks are logged and mitigated throughout the lifecycle, with a defined escalation path and regular review during team rituals. Project quality is maintained by integrating automated and manual testing—unit, integration, smoke tests—into the pull request and release pipeline. Pre-release and deployment checklists, combined with post-release monitoring and blameless retrospectives, drive a culture of continuous improvement and reliability.
