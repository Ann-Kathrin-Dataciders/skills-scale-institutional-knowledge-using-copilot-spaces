# OctoAcme — RACI Matrix Template

## Purpose
A RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrix clarifies who does what for each key activity or deliverable in a project. Use this template to reduce ambiguity and improve accountability.

## RACI Definitions
- **R (Responsible)**: The person(s) who do the work to complete the task
- **A (Accountable)**: The person ultimately answerable for the completion and approval (only one A per task)
- **C (Consulted)**: People whose opinions are sought, typically subject matter experts (two-way communication)
- **I (Informed)**: People who are kept up-to-date on progress (one-way communication)

## How to Use
1. List key activities or deliverables in the leftmost column
2. List project roles across the top row
3. Fill in R, A, C, or I for each role/activity intersection
4. Ensure each activity has exactly one "A" (Accountable)
5. Review with the team to confirm understanding and agreement

## Customization Notes
- Not all roles are needed for every project—remove columns for roles not involved
- Add project-specific activities as needed
- Adjust assignments based on team structure and capabilities
- Review and update the RACI matrix at project kickoff and when roles change

## Best Practices
- Keep it simple—don't map every tiny task
- Focus on key decisions, deliverables, and activities
- Ensure each activity has exactly one "A" (accountable) person
- Limit the number of "C" (consulted) to avoid decision paralysis
- Use in kickoff meetings to align expectations
- Update when scope or team composition changes
