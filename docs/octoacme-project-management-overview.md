# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

## Purpose
Provide a concise, shareable introduction to how OctoAcme runs projects so new teammates can quickly understand our approach, roles, and key artifacts.

## Scope
Applies to all cross-functional projects that deliver product features, services, or integrations.

## Principles
- Customer-first: prioritize customer value and usability.
- Iterative delivery: deliver small, testable increments.
- Clear ownership: each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead.
- Data-informed decisions: measure impact and iterate based on evidence.
- Psychological safety: encourage feedback and learning.

## Core Roles
- **Project Manager (PM)**: coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, communications.
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success.
- **Developers**: implement features, collaborate on design and testability.
- **QA/Testing**: validate quality and acceptance criteria.
- **Scrum Master**: facilitates agile ceremonies, removes blockers, coaches on agile practices.
- **User Experience Lead**: ensures user-centric design, conducts usability reviews.
- **Data Analyst**: tracks metrics, provides insights, validates outcomes.
- **Stakeholder Champion**: represents external stakeholders, manages communication and expectations.
